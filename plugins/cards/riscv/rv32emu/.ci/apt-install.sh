# Install apt packages on a CI runner, tolerating out-of-sync mirrors.
#
# GitHub's Ubuntu images regularly hit mirrors whose Release files lag behind
# the package indexes, which makes "apt-get update" exit non-zero even though
# every package the job needs is available. Failing the whole job on that is
# noise, so the update is advisory and only the install decides the exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   .ci/apt-install.sh <package>...

# Options are passed to this one invocation rather than dropped into
# /etc/apt/apt.conf.d. A persistent file also governs every later apt run,
# including the "apt-get update" inside install-llvm.sh, which runs under set -e
# and would then abort on any repository error.
